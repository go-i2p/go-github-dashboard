# Repository: go-rst

A Go library for parsing and rendering reStructuredText (RST) documents with translation support. Supports only a subset of restructuredText for now, but relatively easy to expand compared to other attempts. It is mostly unrelated to previous attempts to parse restructuredText in Go.
